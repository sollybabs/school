    <p class="right">AFTER YOUR LIFE IN THIS WORLD WHERE WOULD YOU GO?
      This title is a question,which one could answer without much thinking
      "It is heaven"
      Yes,you are right,but which one?Your heaven could be ,hell fire or paradise,
      Hell fire is a place of weeping ,sorrow and gnashing of teeth, 
      and non-stopping burning Rev.20:15.Paradise is a place of bliss where you will 
      join the holy angels to praise God always forever,since you are made in the 
      image and likeness of God.Rev.21:3-4 God wants you to live in joy forever .
      The sin of the first man and woman(Adam/Eve)led to their expulsion from Eden the 
      garden of God,into world where Satan rules and work wickedness and evils hence 
      God regretted that He Created man. Gen 6:5-6.He therefore destroyed the first age with 
      the flood,save Noa and his family of eight.They replenished the earth,still evil persist
      and God sent His son Jesus Christ to save mankind by sacrifice of His blood.
      Whosoever therefore believes that He is the son of God will be saved into eternal 
      life with God. John 3:16 God has given everybody opportunity now to choose it now
      because after death you will face judgement. Heb. 9:27.You can choose death or 
      life hereafter.
      God's word says "he that believes on the Son has everlasting life,and he that believes not 
      not the son shall not see life but wrath of God abideth on him John 3:36.
          The devil wants God's wrath on mankind so that all men could go into hell fire
      after here which is the substantial death.You are strictly enjoined to choose life 
      today.It is a fruitless exercise to investigate God as to divinity of Jesus as son of 
      God.Just believe and you shall be saved ,confess your sin,forsake your sin Act 3:19 
      confess Jesus as Son of God He has authority to save you.Since you,as a descendant
      of condemnation and dammed unholy,you can never be able to save your self.Jesus is the only 
      one from God who has authority to save you from God who has authority to save you 
      from sin and condemnation into everlasting life. </p></div>
